ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Yassir, a programming enthusiast and student!

ðŸ’» I'm currently studying programming, primarily focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have some familiarity with C++ and PHP, and I'm continuously expanding my programming skills.

ðŸŽµ My passion for programming merges with my love for music. I enjoy experimenting with projects that combine both worlds, aiming to bring a unique touch to my work.

ðŸ“š Outside of the classroom, I like to explore new technologies, contribute to open-source projects, and share my programming experiences. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and learning opportunities.

ðŸ“« If you'd like to learn more about me or what I'm working on, feel free to reach out to me at elhallaouiyassir@gmail.com or follow me on Instagram @_.yass.irr_. I'm excited to connect and share our passion for programming and music!
